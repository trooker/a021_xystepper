Three Axes CNC Prototype

Evolution of Project

The goal of this project was to have a learning experience without making a huge investment precision milling or lathe based 
Computer Numeric Controllers. This project involved in experimenting in stepper motor control in the CNCa usage mode. The 
concept was to parse lines of gcode from a file or collection of string inputs. As each line of gcode is parsed the results 
would be processed such that a three axes movement of thr steppes drive shafts would respond with an appropriate amount of 
travel. Stepper shaft angular movement and speed can be controlled with precision.
Working Assumptions:



The working assumptions are:
 
    Basic knowledge of gcode used on CNC mills and lathes
    Experience with Arduino hardware, IDE's, and libraries
    An interest in integrating hardware and software
